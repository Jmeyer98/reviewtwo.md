### Rating

After a short game experience, I rate this game 5 out of 10 joysticks.

## Summary
The story is set in levels. The first level, and beginning of the story, starts out with a shipwreck and the characters being washed ashore on some distant land. As they gather around a fire there is talk of finding survivors. This starts the tutorial of the game. The player is taken step-by-step through the first level of the game. The tutorial continues through to the beginning of the third level. The player is taught the various mechanics of the game in the first to levels. These are all combined by the third. Progression through the levels

One of the many game components is resource management. The player is given the three resources of food, materials, and gold. These are used to clear debris to open paths, building, and hiring workers and soldiers for your army. Food and wood can be gathered at the beginning of each level to get it started. From there the player can build mills for food and lumber yards to materials. Gold is used to hire soldiers and more workers. The gold resource can be collected from completing quests for the villagers in the area and defeating enemies. At later levels you can sell your food and wood for gold. 

Another component is special items and spells. These can be collected from treasure chests, completing quests, and defeating enemies. These can be boost to resource production, healing items, and special items that have various boons. The player can store these items in a special chest at their base camp to be carried over to later levels. These items can also help when fighting enemies with defense spells.

## Final Thoughts

After playing though the first three levels, since these are the only ones available at this time, I've come to like this game. It can be a little slow with collecting resources. It is a more simplistic top-down game that is mostly a click and go. The graphics are nice and transition smoothly from one area to the next. My only problem is how short the levels are. The progression through the levels is so quick that I finished the third level in twenty minutes. Despite this the overall experience was enjoyable and I am looking forward to more levels coming out in future updates.
